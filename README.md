# Social-Wellbeing-Hub---Algo-Arena-Project

Social Wellbeing Hub is a personal wellness toolkit that fosters mental health awareness, emotional reflection, and financial literacy â€” all under one platform. This project was created for the Algo Arena hackathon under the theme of Social Good.

## Problem
